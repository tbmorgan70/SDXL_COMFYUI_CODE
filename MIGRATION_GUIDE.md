# 🔄 Migration Guide - Repository Consolidation

## 📋 Overview
This repository has been consolidated from multiple separate repos into one unified, clean codebase. All tools are now available in one place with improved organization.

## 🎯 What Changed

### **Before: Multiple Repositories**
- `SDXL_COMFYUI_CODE` - Main repo with scattered files
- `sd_comfyui_releases` - Separate sorter releases
- Various development branches and versions

### **After: One Unified Repository**
- **Everything in `SDXL_COMFYUI_CODE`** - Single source of truth
- Clean folder structure with logical separation
- Production-ready tools in dedicated folders
- Legacy versions archived for reference

## 📁 New Structure Mapping

| **Old Location** | **New Location** | **Status** |
|------------------|------------------|------------|
| `sorter_v2_production/` | `sorter/` | ✅ Active (Main Tool) |
| Separate sorter repo | `sorter/` | ✅ Consolidated |
| Root-level Python files | `archive/legacy_scripts/` | 📦 Archived |
| Test files scattered | `tests/` | ✅ Organized |
| Various `sorter_v*` folders | `archive/` | 📦 Archived |

## 🚀 Migration Steps for Users

### **If you were using the separate sorter repo:**
1. **Switch to this main repo**: `https://github.com/tbmorgan70/SDXL_COMFYUI_CODE`
2. **Use the `sorter/` folder** - Same functionality, cleaner structure
3. **Update your bookmarks** to point to this repo

### **If you were using old versions:**
1. **Update to `sorter/`** - Latest production version
2. **Check `archive/`** if you need reference to old code
3. **Use new unified `requirements.txt`**

### **If you had local modifications:**
