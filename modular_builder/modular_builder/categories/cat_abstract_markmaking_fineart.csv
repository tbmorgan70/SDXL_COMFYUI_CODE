broad arm-swing strokes across the horizon
short choppy crosshatch for scrub
long pull with loaded knife for shoreline
feathered stipple for distant rain
calligraphic swoop indicating wind
broken brush dance in foreground
figure-eight motions to cloud mass
zigzag flicks implying grasses
press-and-lift dabs for rocky scree
wide squeegee drift for fog bank
rag twist smear for tree trunks
reverse-draw with solvent to etch light
circular scumble to soften sky
knife tip scoring into wet paint
ink splatter lifted with towel
soft pastel drag over toothy ground
water ripple made with combing tool
roller pass to unify midtones
palette corner notches for fence posts
erased graphite arcs for flight paths
