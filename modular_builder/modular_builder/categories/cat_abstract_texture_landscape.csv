impasto ridges catching raking light
scraped back paint revealing ghost layers
scumbled haze over matte underpainting
palette-knife slabs forming cliff faces
dry-brush grass flickers across midground
salt bloom textures like tidal flats
sand or pumice grit embedded for terrain
sponge-stamped cloud puffs softened
linen weave showing through thin glaze
crackle pattern suggesting drought
dripped runnels like rain erosion
masking-tape edges leaving sharp fields
squeegee pulls creating wind streaks
stencil ghost shapes of tree lines
wax resist beading watercolor pools
charcoal dust rubbed into sky gradient
gel medium peaks for rocky outcrops
collaged paper strata maps
graphite scoring for contour lines
rag wipeouts exposing light paths
