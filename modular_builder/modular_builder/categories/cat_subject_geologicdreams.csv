eroded sandstone towers melting into mist
veinlike rivers of molten glass cutting through shale plains
geodes split open revealing interior skylines
crystalline ridges glowing beneath translucent fog
basalt columns twisted into impossible arches
sediment layers stacked like memory strata
amethyst cliffs fractured by fault-line lightning
hollow mountain echoing with aurora light
petrified forest merging with coral shapes
volcanic vents breathing pastel vapor
desert dunes folding into origami valleys
icebergs tinted coral under refracted suns
mineral storms raining iron dust over valleys
glacial crevasse filled with luminous fog
quartz formations growing across the horizon
canyon walls etched with ancient circuitry
liquid crystal lakes shimmering like mercury
rock spires suspended by magnetic currents
fossilized waves frozen mid-curl
molten plateau pulsing with subterranean glow
