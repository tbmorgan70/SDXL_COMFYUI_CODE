guests smiling with perfect white teeth while their eyes flicker with quiet panic
partygoers wearing expressionless porcelain masks that subtly breathe with them
a woman laughing joyfully as her shadow hugs itself in distress
elite attendees whose facial features briefly misalign before snapping back into place
charming socialites whose reflections stare directly at the viewer, unblinking
a guest adjusting his tie while his mirror image whispers something unheard
people mingling gracefully while faint cracks appear across their skin like drying paint
smiles stretched a fraction too wide, revealing strain beneath the glamour
a hostess projecting calm confidence while her aura trembles in fractured color pulses
guests wearing vintage masquerade masks fused seamlessly into their cheekbones
a stylish woman rehearsing a friendly expression while her inner face glitches beneath
elegant attendees whose eyes momentarily reveal hollow, flickering static
