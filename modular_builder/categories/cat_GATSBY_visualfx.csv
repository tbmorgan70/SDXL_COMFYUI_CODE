soft-focus glamor drifting into shadowed vignettes, edges darkening like a memory collapsing
golden highlights flickering with subtle static, luxury infected by digital decay
velvet-deep shadows pooling unnaturally beneath guests, shapes stretching like liquid ink
iridescent glimmers rippling across surfaces, colors shifting with emotional turbulence
bokeh lights drifting out of alignment, forming brief, unsettling geometric patterns
champagne-sparkle particles floating too slowly, gravity bending as if intoxicated
subtle lens distortion bending straight lines into uneasy curves around tense conversations
mirror‑sheen reflections lagging by a fraction of a second, revealing hidden reactions
soft film‑grain texture thickening when characters become dishonest
ambient haze drifting in unnatural color shifts, as if the room itself is breathing
glittering highlights that strobe faintly during moments of concealed malice
luxurious lighting blooming into warped halos, masking the quiet dread underneath
