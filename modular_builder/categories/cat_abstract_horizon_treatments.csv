razor-thin horizon separating two fields
soft lost-and-found edge bleeding upward
stepped terraces creating tiered horizon
fractured polygon horizon like facets
blurred blend where sky and land merge
inked line horizon over painted fog
sawtooth skyline hinting at industry
double horizon echo for depth illusion
arched horizon bending like fisheye
negative-space horizon carved from color
horizon drifted off-level for tension
horizon swallowed by storm band
thick impasto ridge as cliff line
transparent glaze band as distant sea
dissolved horizon with lifted pigment
horizon masked, then peeled for crisp edge
granulating watercolor band across page
collaged paper strip as shore
graphite horizon drawn on top of paint
erased horizon revealing undercolor
