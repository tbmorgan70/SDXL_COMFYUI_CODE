corrupted texture resembling melted vinyl
bent pixel grid embossed into paint surface
iridescent scan artifacts embedded in glaze
crackle resembling digital interference
matte varnish interrupted by glossy data streaks
banding gradients mimicking screen artifacts
flicker pattern etched beneath transparent layers
static speckle suspended in resin coat
irregular moiré ripples across pigment bands
screen door mesh faintly visible in highlights
laser burn marks leaving violet residue
thermal printer streaks frozen in gel medium
inkjet misregistration creating color halos
lcd backlight glow seeping through pigment
holographic foil distress catching spectral light
diffraction scratches scattering cyan magenta sparks
surface noise rendered as tactile grit
heat distortion waves trapped in clear coat
damaged film grain sealed under matte finish
electronic hum suggested by repeating texture rhythm
