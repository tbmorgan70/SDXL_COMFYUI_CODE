intersecting waveforms collapsing into chaos
exploding vector fields scattering neon debris
shattered timecode bending around the horizon
fragmented reflections pulsing through liquid pixels
dissolving grids vibrating into electric dust
rotating glitch storms caught mid-phase
eroding signal waves bleeding across the frame
strobing interference tearing light apart
syncopated distortions warping chromatic layers
hyperfragmented planes folding into recursion
kinetic feedback loops merging dimensions
collapsing architecture into recursive mirrors
pixel trails bursting from overdriven cores
flickering holographic tides oscillating through noise
entropy bloom expanding across glitchspace
