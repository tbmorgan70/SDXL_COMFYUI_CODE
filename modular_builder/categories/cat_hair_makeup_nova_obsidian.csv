long undercut hair swept to one side
short choppy bob with blunt micro fringe
tight braids pulled into high wired ponytail
shaved sides with textured crown and streaks
loose waves falling over one cybernetic eye
slicked-back hair with wet metallic sheen
twisted knot bun with stray trailing strands
shoulder-length hair threaded with faint glowing fibers
asymmetric cut with one side buzzed close
high puff ponytail with wrapped tech bands
deep charcoal eyeliner with extended winged corners
metallic smoky eyeshadow with cold silver highlights
matte dark lipstick with sharp precise edges
subtle freckling contrasted against pale luminous skin
under-eye liner markings like navigation glyphs
soft contouring with cool-toned shadow emphasis
holographic cheek highlight catching stray ship lights
thin angular brows with precise engineered arches
lip color shifting between plum and black
minimal makeup except stark kohl-rimmed eyes
oil-sheened skin from recycled ship air
dark gradient eyeshadow echoing nebula color palettes
smudged liner as if from long shift
delicate metallic face dots along cheekbones
