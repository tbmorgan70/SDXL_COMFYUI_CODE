distant ridge line as a single stroke
river meander suggested by pale serpentine
shoreline crescent wrapping a bay
field patchwork in gridded bands
tidal flats mirrored as silver planes
storm cell cube hovering on horizon
tree line as vertical bar code
wind farm dots fading into haze
rock stacks implied by stacked blocks
sun disc as a soft-edged oval
rain shadow wedge across mountain face
glacier tongue rendered in cool slabs
canyon switchbacks as zigzag ribbons
dune ridges as parallel comb marks
salt pond rectangles reflecting sky
lava flow as glossy black channels
wetland reeds as clustered ticks
harbor lights as scattered points
quarry cut as stepped planes
cloud shelf as horizontal shelf
