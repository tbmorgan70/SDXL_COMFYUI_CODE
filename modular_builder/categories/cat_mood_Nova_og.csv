abandoned buildings looming like tombstones
"abandoned subway entrance, flickering lights casting long shadows"
"air vibrating with tension, drones circling like vultures"
"burnt ozone scent in the air, light pollution drowning the stars"
"cold beauty in the ruin, everything broken but still trying to shine"
"crumbling highway overpass, vines creeping through the concrete"
distant explosions echoing through the streets
distant sirens buried beneath the pulse of synthetic bass
"distant thunder rolling over steel and glass, rain pattering like static"
"everything damp, metallic, alive but barely breathing"
flickering neon signs casting erratic shadows
flickering streetlights casting long shadows
heartbeat of the city synced with a failing reactor's rhythm
"humming power lines overhead, a low drone in the background"
neon flicker spasming across blood-slick glass
"neon haze blurring the edges of reality, everything dripping wet and glowing"
"paranoia baked into the rain, hope outlawed long ago"
"permanent midnight sky, electric fog drifting between monoliths"
"quiet dread under humming streetlights, puddles reflecting firelight"
"rain never stops, like the city is trying to wash itself clean and failing"
screens whispering propaganda to no one left alive
silence so dense it feels radioactive
"smog thick enough to taste, ghosts of laughter from broken billboards"
"the world smells of oil, rust, and adrenaline"
