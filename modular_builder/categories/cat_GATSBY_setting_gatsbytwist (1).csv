opulent near-future ballroom trembling with faux Art Deco details, cold chrome trim, mirrored walls that bend reflections at impossible angles
decadent champagne atrium lined with holographic murals, partygoers drifting under glitching neon-gas chandeliers
marble grand hall polished to a mirror-like shine, surfaces too reflective, depth warped as if the room is breathing
private garden terrace suspended over dark ocean water, bioluminescent vines curling around wrought-iron railings like invasive thoughts
lavish rooftop pavilion overlooking a city skyline flickering like unstable holograms, golden drapes billowing with unnatural slow motion
underground speakeasy reconstructed from archival photos, walls sweating condensation, bar lights melting into soft surreal halos
artificial starlight courtyard with floating lanterns—each lantern flickers with distorted silhouettes of the guests below
gilded jazz hall rebuilt in synthetic marble, engraved panels shifting hue with emotional temperature of the crowd
crystal-lined staircases spiraling upward in fractal patterns, each step subtly off rhythm like a heartbeat under stress
opulent casino lounge buzzing with quiet drone surveillance, vintage slot machines that glitch and display guests’ fears instead of numbers
makeshift prohibition bar hidden behind sliding LED panels, smoky atmosphere tinted with faint acid-green haze
hanging garden ballroom with hydroponic vines dripping luminous nectar, air thick with manufactured floral perfume that feels too sweet to trust
