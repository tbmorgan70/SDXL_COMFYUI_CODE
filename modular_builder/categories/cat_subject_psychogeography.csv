mapless city built from remembered streets
neighborhoods folding inward like origami thoughts
bridges connecting memories instead of places
mirage of home hovering above unfamiliar ground
cartographic grid dissolving into watercolor spill
alleyways leading to impossible oceans
terrain shaped by collective nostalgia
staircases climbing into clouds of static
avenues arranged by emotion not logic
echoing architecture built from recurring dreams
empty plazas filled with phantom footsteps
skyline rearranging itself as you recall it
topography formed from fading recollections
labyrinth city humming with subconscious signals
tower reflected perfectly into the sky below
fog erasing distinction between land and time
streetlamps flickering with forgotten language
railway looping through parallel memories
roads spiraling into their own blueprints
distant hills whispering the names of lost towns
