morning mist lifting into pale blue
heat shimmer warping distant ridge
rain curtain veiling the background
snow flurry dashes over muted fields
sea spray sparkle near rocky coast
dust storm band swallowing horizon
evening alpenglow on far peaks
moonlit silver wash across water
low cloud ceiling compressing space
thermal updraft twisting clouds
after-storm clarity with crisp edges
ground fog pooling in river bends
aurora veil rippling above skyline
smoke haze filtering late sun
sunshafts breaking through overcast
distant lightning glow beyond hills
blue hour saturation deepening shadows
dew sparkle catching first light
subsurface glow from snowpack
mirage band floating above sand
