hand-drawn line jittering like unstable signal
brushstroke skipping across canvas like dropped frames
pixel smear overlaying graphite mark
digital ghost echo of erased charcoal
paint stroke duplicated with slight frame offset
crosshatch pattern drifting out of register
ink bleed simulated by noise algorithm
looped brush motion forming waveform interference
knife scrape leaving repeated scanline grooves
hatching pattern aliased at oblique angle
airbrush fade collapsing into pixel banding
splatter spray locked to grid coordinates
smudge distorted as if by compression blur
marker streak looping like corrupted gif
roller mark repeating at fractal interval
eraser ghost forming ghostly afterimage trail
vector line quantized into stepped geometry
graphite dust turned to digital noise field
overshoot motion trails forming glitch aura
paint flick resolving into binary pattern
