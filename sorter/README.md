## 🚀 New Feature Guide

### 🧬 LoRA Stack Sorting
Perfect for finding images that use identical LoRA combinations:

1. Select **"Sort by LoRA Stack"** from the dropdown
2. Choose your ComfyUI output folder
3. Images will be grouped by their exact LoRA combinations:
   ```
   output/lora_sorted/
   ├── DetailTweaker_and_FilmGrain/     # Images with these 2 LoRAs
   ├── CyberPunk_and_Neon_and_Glitch/ # Images with these 3 LoRAs  
   ├── Glitchcore_SDXL/                # Images with this 1 LoRA
   └── no_loras/                       # Images without LoRAs
   ```

### 📄 Metadata-Only Mode
Extract comprehensive metadata without disrupting your file organization:

1. Select **"Generate Metadata"** from the dropdown
2. Choose source folder with your images
3. Creates detailed .txt files alongside each image:
   ```
   my_image.png
   my_image.txt  ← Contains: checkpoint, LoRAs, prompts, settings
   ```

### 📁 Auto-Open Results
Every operation now ends with the **"📁 Open Output Folder"** button:
- Automatically appears after successful operations
- Cross-platform folder opening (Windows Explorer, macOS Finder, Linux file manager)
